                <h1>Teaching</h1>
                <p>I served as a programming instructor for the TreeTree2 Afterschool's Program which is a
                    program with various courses, that encourages students of many ages to delve into 
                    subjects that are not presented early in school. All of the content provided by 
                    these courses is created by teachers, engineers, investigators and the highest 
                    callibre of students that the country has to offer.
                    <p>
                        The course I participated on was Programming, where our goal was to teach all 
                        the first steps into becoming an elite class programmer.

                <p>I participated as a summer internee alongside numerous other students from different
                    Portuguese universities in Critical Software's Innovation Experience. My group's task
                    was to develop an application related to virtual cycling where, with the use of a real 
                    bycicle and a VR headset, an immersive experience could be provided to the user.
